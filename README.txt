h1. COBALT

Thank you for downloading Cobalt. Cobalt is a way to control Drupal 6 made in the image of "Quicksilver":http://docs.blacktree.com/quicksilver/what_is_quicksilver for Mac. So far it's confirmed to work in Safari/Webkit and Firefox 3. In Firefox, and other potentially compatible browsers, Google Gears have to be installed for quicksilver to work. This is due to Cobalt's need to store data locally for fast access.

h2. INSTRUCTIONS

Cobalt is invoked through pressing [Alt+space] or [Ctrl+space]. Then you only have to start typing to quickly get what you want. Use the arrow up/down to select one of the suggestions and [Alt+left/right] to switch between the the pages. Cobalt will learn from your choices so the amount of selecting and paging will decrease over time. If you are satisfied with the default action (Go to for menu items) you can just press enter to execute it. If you want to do something else (maybe you would like to assign a shortcut) just press [tab] and select one of the actions using the arrow keys or typing part of the action name. The press enter to execute the selected action.

The Cobalt Nodes module also provides convenient context entries like "Edit current node", that, just like any other entry, you can assign shortcuts to. Then you can assign shortcuts like [Ctrl+e], [Ctrl+v] and [Ctrl+Shift+d] to edit, view or delete the node whose page you're currently on.

h2. INSTALLATION

Cobalt consists of four modules. The Cobalt module contains Cobalt itself and access to the menu system, including the devel modules menu items (do you use clear cache often? Assign it a shortcut like [Ctrl+Shift+c] and life *will* get easier.). The three other modules: Cobalt Nodes, Cobalt Taxonomy and Cobalt Users provides access to exactly the stuff their names imply with sensible actions like view, edit and delete.  

We now have modules in place that supports lookup for menus, nodes, users and taxonomy. Nodes and users have view, edit and delete actions that can be accessed by tabbing to the right cell and pressing the up and down arrow keys.
