COBALT MODULE FOR DRUPAL
------------------------

Cobalt is a way to control Drupal 6 made in the image of Quicksilver for Mac:
http://docs.blacktree.com/quicksilver/what_is_quicksilver
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacktree_Software

So far it's confirmed to work in Safari/Webkit and Firefox 3. In Firefox, and 
other potentiallly compatible browsers, Google Gears have to be installed for 
quicksilver to work.

The module lives over at github, and this is early alpha stuff, but it works 
and can be used for navigation in dev projects at least. Take a look and clone

This project has been added on behalf of Hugo Wetterbergh, the author of the 
module: http://drupal.org/user/208601
